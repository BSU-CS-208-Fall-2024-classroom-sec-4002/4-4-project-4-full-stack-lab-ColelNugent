## Experience

My experience during this fourth project was really fun. I had a great time finally getting to
work in both the front end of development using pug and also developing in the back end using
javascript for sql databases. To test my project I used the nodejs server and would just consistantly
refresh my page whenever I needed to test if whatever I was working on was working or possibly
breaking my entire project. I struggled to understand how the server.js code worked but after watching the
module walkthrough video and doing some research I know decently understand it. There were no parts within
this project that were unclear or poorly specified, all parts that needed to explained were explained
thouroughly which is important. I was able to get the entire project done. I learned many new things
during this project but the biggest one was just how backend development works as a whole. I've never
done it before so this was a great learning experience for me. Now I am excited for the final project to see what
I will be able to learn from that.
